      "I got these to use mainly when on the mower and they work well. They are lightweight and comfortable. I think more expensive ones would be a little better at the noise canceling but they are certainly adequate. The sound quality is good as well. They connected easily to my phone as well. I havenâ€™t had a problem with the battery life but have only had for a week; so far so good. They also seem like they will also be durable.",

      "When I placed these on my head and got them paired up with my phone. I played some music and was decently surprised. Comfort was good and sound was great. Not heavy on the bass for music but good for listening to the lyrics. Wearing them at work for 3 hours they got a little warm around my ears and had them sit on my shoulders. It was nicely designed so that the ear covers could be turned to face upwards so they were like little speakers sitting on my shoulders. I'd give time two thumbs up for this price range. I'd buy them again too for a friend.",
