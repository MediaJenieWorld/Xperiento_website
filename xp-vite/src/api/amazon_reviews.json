Although, the two with animal print seem to be thicker and those two I have to hit the screen hard to make it work. I don\u2019t know why maybe the plastic is thicker on those two.I just don\u2019t use those. I love these and won\u2019t use my watch with out these screen protectors. My watch screen would be so scratched by now if I didn\u2019t use these. They\u2019re great!I\u2019m definitely very happy with these. So easy to put on and take off also.\n",

I ordered these and was pleasantly surprised when they arrived.  There are many different colors/patterns in the package and they snap onto my watch with ease.  They're stylish and do a GREAT job protecting my watch face.My only problem with them is that they don't always respond right away to my touch - I have to tap on them several times to get them to wake the watch face up and allow me to do anything.  Other than that, they're fantastic!\n",

If you\u2019re simply looking for a fashionable designed the cover your Apple Watch, and to be able to change them out frequently then they are sufficient for what you\u2019re looking for. They will protect your Apple Watch, however, if you are doing any type of construction, yardwork or anything that is high level of movement where you\u2019re bumping them frequently, you do chance them popping off. I would not write them as a high-level protection. If your band is neutral as in black white, then they will match any color you put with the cover. If you have any designs on your band, then you will only be able to use a few of these to have them matching. The actual colors that come within the package are a bit off-the-wall. For the cost, I would say that you\u2019re going to get a decent value because you\u2019re not paying very much for these, so I guess the value does match the cost. Maybe that\u2019s the reason why full protection is much more expensive and you don\u2019t get the fashion. The seller was easy to work with and shipment was fast. As far as their ability. Yes, these in itself are durable, but again they do pop off easily.\n",

The only thing that I've noticed is that if I were to leave my watch on the counter when showering the steam manages to get behind the screen protector and looks horrible and can screw up the touch screen, but for the price I usually just let it sit out for a day or two usually when I forget to charge it, thanks ADHD, and it'll sometimes dry out itself, if not I toss it and use one of the other ones. Thank you so much for this awesome product. Keep up the great work.\n",
